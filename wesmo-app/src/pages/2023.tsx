              In the face of towering challenges, our small but mighty team at
              WESMO stood resilient, overcoming every obstacle with unwavering
              unity and determination. From setbacks to late nights, we
              transformed adversity into fuel for our collective fire. Today, as
              the competition concludes, we're not just a team; we're a family
              bound by passion, grit, and an unbreakable spirit. Our journey
              wasn't just about building a car; it was about forging unshakable
              bonds and leaving an indelible mark of perseverance and unity.
              <br />
              <br />
              We managed to get second place in the Skid pan and Autocross
              events under the internal combustion category and unfortunately
              did not get to finish the endurance event in the second half but
              we are very happy about what we were able to achieve under many
              challenges. We've learned a lot this year and hope to come back
              stronger next year. Special thanks to all our sponsors and
              supervisors who made this achievement possible. - WESMO 2023
