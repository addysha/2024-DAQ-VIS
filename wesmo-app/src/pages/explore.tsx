                  pedal box was adjustable, the force taken to move the pedal
                  box was high and the difficulty to adjust due to alignment
                  issues with the pegged holes made it often unusable. The 2023
                  pedal box utilises slider rails, for easy adjustibility. This
                  design also makes use of heel rests for driver comfort.

                  Performance if any car is highly dependent on the final drive

                  system was implemented into the main brackets, where the
                  differential and sprokets are mounted off centre in the
                  bearing mounts. The differential/sproket assembly can be

                  1. Downforce. At 80kmh the undertray produces approximately
                  300N of downforce. This downforce acts about the centreline of
                  the car and counters the cars natural rollover tendencies
                  associated with its relatively narrow wheelbase.

                  2.Centre of gravity. Becuase the undertray is located very low
                  on the car, despite adding weight it is a net benefit to the
                  cars cornering ability as it lowers the cars centre of gravity
                  slightly, again reducing the cars rollover tendencies.

                  addition of an undertray will improve marketability of the car
                  for sponsors and the university.
