                Formula Society of Automotive Engineers, more commonly known as
                FSAE. Each year there is a competition where 30-35 teams compete
                against each other from across Oceania. Participants can hail
                from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, and Europe,
                representing a fraction of the over 600 teams worldwide. The
                competition puts the student-built race cars through varying
                events which are categorised as either “static” or “dynamic”.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                The static events consist of design, cost, and a business pitch
                to investors. The dynamic events consist of skid pad,
                acceleration, autocross, efficiency, and endurance.
                <br />
                <br />
                In recent years, there has been a notable shift from internal
                combustion to electric vehicles among participating teams, with
                electric cars proving increasingly competitive.
